   <br><h1><u>2022 Cyclones Mandous and ARB 03</u></h1>
   <img src="cyclones.jpg" alt="Image Description" class="information-image">
   <br><br>
   <p>Severe Cyclonic Storm Mandous was the third cyclonic storm, as well as the third most intense tropical cyclone of the 2022 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. The remnants of the system later regenerated into Deep Depression ARB 03 in the Arabian Sea. The system struck the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as well as South India. The Indian Meteorological Department issued a bulletin stating that a tropical depression had formed in the Bay of Bengal and was designated BOB 09. The JTWC, released a TCFA on the system, stating that it could intensify further, because of very warm waters and low to moderate wind shear, designating it Invest 96B. A day later, both the JTWC and IMD classified this low pressure as a "cyclonic storm" and it was named Mandous. Mandous continued tracking westward, and later, attaining wind speeds of 65 mph (105 km/h; 56 kn), strengthened into a Severe Cyclonic Storm. As it continued tracking westward, land interaction caused in to fall to Cyclonic Storm intensity. It later made landfall around Chennai, India as a Deep Depression. It fell to Depression intensity, and later degenerated into a remnant low.</p>
   <br><h1><u>2021 Cyclone Yaas</u></h1><br>
   <p>Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Yaas was a relatively strong and very damaging tropical cyclone that made landfall in Odisha and brought significant impacts to West Bengal during late May 2021. The second cyclonic storm, second severe cyclonic storm, and second very severe cyclonic storm of the 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Yaas formed from a tropical disturbance that the Indian Meteorological Department first monitored on May 23. Conditions in the basin favored development as the system became a deep depression later that day, before intensifying into a cyclonic storm on the next day, receiving the name Yaas. The system further intensified as it turned to the northeast, becoming a severe cyclonic storm on May 24 despite moderate wind shear. Marginally favorable conditions further continued as Yaas accelerated northeastward, strengthening to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone and to a very severe cyclonic storm on May 25. Yaas crossed the northern Odisha coast around 20 km south of Balasore at its peak intensity as a very severe cyclonic storm on May 26. Upon landfall, the JTWC and IMD issued their final advisories as Yaas further weakened inland while turning north-northwestwards.</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>In preparations for the storm, many electrical companies in West Bengal and Odisha prepared additional generators and transformers for possible electrical problems. Evacuations were also ordered, starting on May 24 on low-lying areas in East Midnapore and West Midnapore and Jhargram. Hooghly, Kolkata and North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas are now placed on high alert. Railway operations and marine activities were halted due to Yaas, while rescue authorities and medical teams were deployed in for possible emergencies. In Bangladesh, over two million individuals were ordered to be evacuated in coastal areas of the country due to the storm's approach. Food supplies and emergency funds were also released for the evacuees. 20 people across India and Bangladesh died due to Yaas. West Bengal was the hardest hit Indian state, with an estimated loss of ₹210 billion (US$2.89 billion). Odisha also suffered a loss of ₹6.1 billion (US$83.9 million).</p>
   <br><br>
   <h1><u>Cyclone Biparjoy</u></h1><br><br>
   <p>Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Biparjoy was a long lived, powerful tropical cyclone that formed over the east-central Arabian Sea. The third depression and the second cyclonic storm of the 2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Biparjoy originated from a depression that was first noted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 6 June, before intensifying into a cyclonic storm. The cyclone steadily weakened due to deep flaring convection. Biparjoy accelerated northeastward, strengthening to a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone and an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The cyclone made landfall in Naliya, India on June 16. Biparjoy was downgraded to a depression, and further into a well-marked low-pressure area late on 19 June. Named by Bangladesh, Biparjoy means 'calamity' in Bengali language.
   <br><br>On June 12, the IMD issued alerts to local authorities in Gujarat, encouraging them to prepare for possible evacuations. Residents in coastal areas were warned to stay indoors as the storm approached. Gujarat's government responded by dispatching national and state disaster response teams to the affected areas. 81,000 people were evacuated from Pakistan's southeast coast. At least 23 people were injured as well as 4,600 villages were affected by power outages in India. A total of 12 people were confirmed to have been killed in India.</p>
   <br><br><h2><u>Meteorological History</u></h2><br><br>
   <p>On 1 June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the potential for a formation of a cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea.[3] A cyclonic circulation formed over the Arabian Sea on June 5. On the same day, a low-pressure area formed as a result of the cyclonic circulation.[5] The following day, it significantly intensified into a depression. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system as a result, marking it as Invest 92A. The IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and subsequently to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name Biparjoy. The JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 02A.  Six hours later as its convection evolved into a central dense overcast (CDO) with a nascent eye, Biparjoy steadily strengthened, gaining Category 1-equivalent winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). 
        <br><br>
        By 00:00 UTC on 7 June, the IMD upgraded the system to a severe cyclonic storm with 3-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). Biparjoy cloud tops warmed and the convective burst collapsed, resulting in an upper-level outflow from the storm and pushing it back towards its system core. Biparjoy was upgraded to a very severe cyclonic storm at 06:00 UTC, at which point the system became a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The cyclone was sheared due to moderate easterly vertical wind shear, with the deep convection displaced from the low-level circulation center. The cyclone steadily weakened due to deep flaring convection. Biparjoy unexpectedly rapidly intensified and became a Category 3-equivalent cyclone on 11 June. 
        <br><br>Biparjoy reached its peak intensity as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, with maximum 3-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). The shear decreased and convective organization and areal extent increased. Banding features became increasingly evident in satellite images along the southern periphery. Biparjoy gradually weakened with convective banding over the northern semicircle. The structure of the cyclone quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric. Biparjoy made landfall on June 16 near Naliya, India, with sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). Shortly after the landfall, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system. The cyclone weakened into a depression.] The depression was later marked as a well-marked low-pressure area by the IMD on June 19, prompting the discontinuation of advisories on the system. Biparjoy broke the record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy of any North Indian Ocean cyclone, passing Cyclone Kyarr's 2019 mark. 
        <br><br>Gujarat's coastal areas experienced heavy rains and strong winds, resulting in the loss of three lives in Kutch and Rajkot districts. Trees were uprooted, and a wall collapsed due to the severe weather conditions. Additionally, in Kutch, strong waves swept away tents situated on Mandvi Beach. As the cyclone approached the coast, the Dwarka region experienced high tides. Damage to the electricity network in Gujarat was valued at ₹10.13 billion (US$123.7 million), though the Indian National Congress estimated damage statewide at ₹80–100 billion (US$0.98–1.22 billion). The neighboring state of Maharashtra also witnessed heavy rains and high tidal waves. Four boys who had gone missing after venturing into the Arabian Sea near Mumbai's Juhu area were found deceased. A total of 23 people were injured as well as 4,600 villages were affected by power outages. Five people died in Rajasthan. Hospitals in northwest India received a high number of people who had been bitten by snakes after a cyclone hit the region Rajasthan. In July 2023, the Government of Gujarat announced relief package of ₹2.4 billion (US$29 million) for farmers. The government estimated crops and trees spread across 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of land was damaged by the cyclone.
