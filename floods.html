   <br><h1><u>2023 North India Floods</u></h1><br>
   <img src="floods.jpg" alt="Image Description" class="information-image">
<p>Heavy rainfall during the 2023 monsoon season resulted in severe flooding and landslides across Northern India, primarily affecting residents in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi.<br><br>
A monsoon surge, coupled with a western disturbance has led to the highest rainfall in decades in some parts of the region, causing nearby rivers to overflow, with flooding and landslides washing away vehicles, destroying bridges and roads, and disrupting power and electricity.<br><br>
In July, at least 105 individuals across Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, were killed over a two-week period of intense rain and flooding, with thousands of others evacuated to relief camps. The floods have led to closure of schools, disruption of flights and train operations in various parts of North India. Another period of intense torrential rain continued in August, and at least 71 more people were killed in Himachal Pradesh, while 10 others died in Uttarakhand.<br><br></p>
<h1>Affected Areas</h1><br>
<h2><u>Himachal Pradesh</u></h2><br>
<p>The state of Himachal Pradesh was the hardest hit, with at least 330 dead, 38 missing and more than 100 injured during flooding since 1 April. More than 1,000 roads were blocked in the state as a result of downed power lines and other damaged infrastructure. Approximately 70,000 tourists were evacuated from the state, as reported by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu. Rescue operations were led by teams from the Indian army and the National Disaster Response Force. Several districts experienced an entire month's worth of rainfall within a single day. In Manali, roads were swept away by the deluge, leaving both tourists and their vehicles stranded. <br><br>
Over the weekend of August 12-13, 2023, additional torrential rains hit Shimla, triggering landslides and destroying a temple, homes, and buildings, and killing at least 57 people. The intensity of the rains has been attributed to climate change The landslides washed out several roads, including the Himalayan Expressway, and sections of the Kalkaâ€“Shimla Railway. The additional floods and landslides killed a total of 71 people. A massive landslide destroyed roads and buildings in the city of Shimla.<br><br>
Cumulatively, since the monsoon hit on June 24, 170 incidents of cloudburst or landsliding have been reported and 9,600 houses have been damaged in Himachal Pradesh. Chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu has stated that the losses from the combined floods of 2023 have been as high as 10,000 crore rupees, and the damaged infrastructure would take a year to repair.<br><br>
</p>
<h2><u>Punjab</u></h2><br>
<p>On 9 July 2023, a high alert was issued in different districts of Punjab due to incessant rains. There were a surfeit of waterlogged roads and many cars were submerged in water. The situation worsened in Patiala and Dera Bassi as fields were inundated. Many roads caved in, disrupting the traffic. The rains did not show any signs of abating as it had been profusely raining for the past three days. On 10 July 2023, an order was passed to close all schools, which reopened on 17 July. </p>
<br><h2><u>Delhi</u></h2><br>
<p>The capital city of Delhi saw over 153 millimetres (6.0 in) rain on 9 July 2023, marking the highest precipitation in a single day in July in over 40 years. Authorities took measures to relocate numerous individuals residing near Yamuna riverbanks to safer areas. In addition, residents in other susceptible regions were advised to make necessary arrangements for potential evacuations. The traffic flow across a critical bridge spanning the river was disrupted, and schools were closed. Flooding in the capital lead to at least one death. <br><br>
The Yamuna river breached its all-time high-water mark, which had stood for over 45 years. The situation impacted prominent areas, including the street outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence and a major road towards Connaught Place, a renowned business center. Chief Minister Kejriwal urged the federal government to regulate the water release from the Hathnikund Barrage in Haryana, which contributed to the swelling of the Yamuna river. Flooding of the Yamuna river also resulted in water surrounding the Red Fort. <br><br>
Sixteen thousand individuals were provided shelter in relief tents arranged by the Delhi government. The state's governor convened with the Delhi Disaster Management Authority to discuss the flood situation. Kejriwal mentioned that an advisory would be issued for private offices to encourage remote work. Due to the flood-like situation, three water treatment plants in Delhi were temporarily shut down. As a result, water was rationed. Furthermore, heavy vehicles, with the exception of those engaged in essential services, were prohibited from entering Delhi. <br><br>
</p>
<br><h2><u>Kashmir</u></h2><br>
<p>Due to damage to a national highway, the Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage was suspended. As a result, thousands of pilgrims were stranded in nearby areas. At least four people were killed in the state.</p>
<br><h2><u>Haryana</u></h2><br>
<p>For the first time in history, Haryana was put under a flood warning. Farmers are preparing to lose up to 30% of their rice yield.</p>
<br><h2><u>Rajasthan</u></h2><br>
<p>Over 2,800 people were evacuated in anticipation of floods.</p>
<br><h2><u>Uttarakhand</u></h2><br>

<br>
<h1><u>2022 Silchar Floods</u></h1><br>
<p>The 2022 Silchar Floods were floods that occurred in the state of Assam, India beginning 19 June 2022, due to a breach of dyke of the Barak River at Bethkundi. The flooding affected 5.4 million people across 32 districts and caused the deaths of over 200 people across the effected districts. Silchar town, located just 1 km from the dyke was the worst affected, with 90 percent of the town underwater. While there are several reasons that caused the floods in the region to the extent that it did, there is a definite man-made aspect to the degree of damage that it caused. The Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sharma also noted this in his address to the people.
<br><br>
On 2 July, one man named Kabul Khan was arrested for breaching the embankment which caused the floods. He had also taken a video of the breach. By 6 July, 3 more people were arrested for the deed. The Chief Minister of Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the flood was a man made calamity and those responsible would face a harsh punishment. He termed the act as a sabotage.
<br><br>
Silchar town remained submerged for 11 days, with water rising up to 12 feet (3.7 metres)Â inÂ someÂ places.</p><br><br>
